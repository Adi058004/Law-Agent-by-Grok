## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Components Don't Work:**

#### **Issue**: "ML Classifier not available"
**Solution**: 
```bash
python ml_domain_classifier.py
# Check if training_data.json is created
```

#### **Issue**: "Route Engine not available"  
**Solution**:
```bash
python dataset_driven_routes.py
# Check if legal_case_data.json is created
```

#### **Issue**: "Constitutional integration not available"
**Solution**:
```bash
python constitutional_integration.py
# Check if article.json exists
```

#### **Issue**: Unicode/encoding errors
**Solution**: The working_enhanced_agent.py fixes these issues automatically
